Hi, I’m @CoDoKoe
I’m interested in database administration, webbased application, HTML, javascript and php. In the past years I worked with AlphaFive, Alphaanywhere and Lotus Approach. I have created Windows desktop applications and also converted them into web applications. 
I’m currently learning php and javascript.

The xbasic class was developed to create calendar entries in EGroupware. The appointments are supplemented with data from the AlphaAnywhere application and transmitted to the WebDav server of EGroupware via PUT.
