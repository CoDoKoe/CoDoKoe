Hi, I’m @CoDoKoe
I’m interested in database administration, webbased application, HTML, javascript and php. In the past years I worked with AlphaFive, Alphaanywhere and Lotus Approach. I have created Windows desktop applications and also converted them into web applications. 
I’m currently learning php and javascript.
