- 👋 Hi, I’m @CoDoKoe

- 🌱 I’m currently learning php and javascript.
- 💞️ I am currently looking for support in the development of appointment scheduling and entry in calendars and project planning. I would also like to create SEPA files for payment processing. Furthermore, I am working on the export and import of accounting data for the current accounting and operational key data collection.
